# Implementing Simulated Annealing for a Logical OR Gate

## About this Project:
This project applies the Simulated Annealing algorithm to model a Boolean logical OR gate. For each iteration, a configuration of three different weights--W<sub>x</sub>, W<sub>y</sub>, and W<sub>b</sub>--is randomly 
generated. These configurations are then accepted or rejected based on the annealing schedule.
